|**🌐1- The development of a chatbot using Convolutional Neural Networks**| 2022 |1.How do different CNN architectures impact chatbot performance?|1.Accuracy      2.Training Speed|Did author compared  CNN chatbot to simpler models or rule-based systems? How well does it handle complex or open ended questions?| |
|**🌐2- Machine learning algorithms for teaching AI chat bots** | 2021 |1. Which machine learning algorithms are most successful in training AI chatbots for various tasks?|N/A|The paper does not cover various methods for evaluating the effectiveness of chatbot training algorithms. How can we measure a chatbot's ability to hold natural conversations, understand user intent, and generate appropriate responses?|Microservice architecture is used and the speed of message processing and preparation of responses by the chatbot will not change depending on the load on the server and the number of incoming messages. |
|**🌐3- Personified Robotic Chatbot Based On Compositional Dialogues** | 2022 |Research likely doesn't focus on specific questions but rather explores how compositional dialogues (where conversations are built from smaller elements) can be used to create a personified robotic chatbot.|N/A|1. How effectively can the level of personality be measured in these chatbots?          2.Is user perception the only metric, or can objective measures be developed?| |
| **🌐4- Boosting the Accuracy of Optimization Chatbot by Random Forest with Halving Grid Search Hyperparameter Tuning**| 2023 |1.Can hyperparameter tuning with a Halving Grid Search method improve the accuracy of an optimization chatbot built using a Random Forest algorithm?|1.Accuracy    2.Precision    3.Recall  |The paper proposes three chatbot models: 1.One without hyperparameter tuning 2.One with hyperparameter tuning using Halving Grid Search 3.One with hyperparameter tuning and the best performing settings| |   
|**🌐5- Developing a Chatbot using Machine Learning**| 2019|1.Can machine learning algorithms improve the ability of a chatbot to understand natural language queries?  2. How does the choice of machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural networks, decision trees) impact the performance of a chatbot?|1. BLEU Score (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy)  2.Turing Test|This paper does not Investigate the impact of different visual design elements on user attention and engagement with the chatbot.| |

### 🎯 Research Objective
This thesis proposes a hybrid text summarization model combining T5 and BERT to enhance summary coherence and factual accuracy, benchmarked on a custom dataset.

### 🎯 Research Questions
1- How to implement a hybrid method for text summarization that combines the Word Frequency Algorithm with transformer models like T5 and BART?

2- How to enhance the accuracy of abstractive models T5 and BART by fine-tuning on a self-created dataset?
