## **General Points** 

**Tense**

Below. The tense of a verb reflects the timing of the action. Choosing the correct verb tense for each section of a scientific manuscript can be challenging, but it is worth the effort. Editorials in several journals have noted that proper verb tense is an important aspect of a well-written manuscript, and some journals and publishers specifically mention verb tense in their style guides.
- **Past tense** indicates that action already occurred.
- **Present tense**: indicates that the action is currently occurring.
- **Future tense** indicates that the event has not yet occurred.
- **Future perfect tense**: in which the action is defined relative to another point in time
- **Active voice**: Use for clarity and ownership.
- **Passive voice**: Use sparingly for objectivity. process and transmit information.

**Writing**

- Avoid very long paragraphs and sentences
- consider using heading, bullets, italics, and boldface (But do not overuse these)
- Make easy-to-understand graphics
- Ensure that there is no disconnect in the flow of information from the title to the references.
- Avoiding inconsistency and vagueness
- **Start Writing Early**:One of the most significant misconceptions in academic writing is the belief that research should be completed before starting to write. In reality, initiating the writing process early can be incredibly beneficial. By beginning to write with a microscopic idea, you can clarify your thoughts and identify the research needed to support your claims. This approach allows you to focus on the essential components of your paper and can prevent you from veering off into irrelevant details.
- Writing early also facilitates discussions with colleagues. When you have a draft, even if it’s incomplete, you have something tangible to share and discuss. This collaborative effort can lead to new insights and improvements in your work.

**Editing**

- Before submitting your manuscript to a journal read the final version several times
- Seek feedback from others

**Identify Your Key Idea**

First discuss with seniors abroad and professors in your university about it. Understanding the core idea of your paper is crucial. The purpose of writing is to convey a reusable insight from your mind to that of your readers. It’s essential that by the end of your writing process, both you and your readers are clear about this key idea. Reviewers often highlight papers that lack clarity in this area, so make it a priority to articulate your main insight clearly.

If your work involves multiple ideas, consider separating them into different papers. Overloading a single paper with too many concepts can lead to confusion and dilute the impact of your primary message

**Choose some topic**

Then choose some topic, relevant to you , may be thesis
Download the papers relevant to the topic you chose. Any papers, review papers, novel, modifications etc are good.Download almost 30 or more papers read them. Not just read them but understand them. I know it takes time. But once you will start, you will get used to it.
While doing it, your mind will start making ideas, just start writing them somewhere. Again discuss with seniors, professors and friends after reading those papers. Then narrow down your topic further and download papers relevant to that topic again almost 20 or more papers or as many as you can find.

**Narrowed down topic**

When you read all papers in your narrowed down topic, your mind would have already started making ideas about any of these things that are required for every paper to publish Novelty, Modifications, Improvement, product
So you will work on any of those ideas by thinking new novel method. Or will combine many methods that you have read in papers or use any method that you read to improve some already used method. So any of the combinations, you can try. If you dun have any idea, you can use all the papers that you have read on specific topic to make a review paper. But review paper should include all the work that have been presented about that topic before in a good and concise way

**Seek Feedback and Revise**

Feedback is an invaluable part of the writing process. Share your drafts with peers and encourage them to give constructive criticism, particularly regarding clarity and flow. It’s essential to ask them where they got lost or confused, as this information can guide your revisions. When you receive reviews on your submitted papers, approach them with an open mind. Even if the feedback stings, it’s crucial to see it as an opportunity for growth. Consider how you can refine your work based on the insights provided, striving for clarity that even a novice in your field can grasp.
